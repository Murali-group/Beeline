Description: The package implements a straightforward, effective and robust computational method for Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) inference from time series scRNA-seq data, which is coined as scEM-SEM. The framework is based on Structural Equation Model (SEM) and extended to non-Gaussian situation to accommadate the tremendous technical and biological noises.
